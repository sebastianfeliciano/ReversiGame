/**
 * <p>The {@code IROModel} interface represents the read-only view of a Reversi game.
 * Reversi is played on a pointy-top orientation hex grid using an axial coordinate system.
 * Implementing classes provide methods for querying the game state without allowing
 * modifications to the game board (i.e., players can observe the state of the Reversi game
 * through this interface without altering the ongoing gameplay).</p>
 *
 * <p>In the Reversi game, players take turns to place their discs on the grid.
 * Discs are placed in empty cells in a way that enclose the opponent's discs
 * in a straight line. Enclosed opponent's discs are then flipped or captured to the
 * current player's color. The game ends when the grid is fully occupied,
 * no valid moves are possible, or both players pass their turns.
 * The player with the most discs of their color on the grid at the end of the game wins.
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes must ensure thread safety when providing access to the game state.</p>
