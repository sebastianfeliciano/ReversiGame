/**
 * The class {code AvoidNextToCornerStrat }represents a strategy for choosing a move in Reversi
 * that avoids the cells adjacent to corners. For instance, if there was a game of Reversi with
 * the radius of 2, the hex (0, -2) would be the corner, and this strategy would
 * avoid the cells (1, -2), (1, -1), and (0, -1).
 * If there is a tie between the various options (i.e., there is more
 * than one cell that is not a neighbor of a corner), this strategy will choose the upper left
 * most option (upper is taken priority of left). Its main method {@code chooseMove} returns
 * an {@code Optional<Hex>} because it is a fallible strategy.
