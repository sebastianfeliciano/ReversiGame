   * <p>In addition to setting up the dimensions of the panel, this constructor also sets up
   * information about each hex coord. This information is rendered onto the panel to aid the
   * player understand which hex they are placing a disc on. The coord info is a {@code JLabel}
   * that can be conveniently removed, should the player decide that they do not want to include
   * hex coordinate information in the view. This method also calculates the width and height
   * of each hexagon based on the value of {@code sideLength}. It sets the value of the

   * constructed.</p>
