# Reversi Game Project HW 8

## Overview

This README provides a summary of the implemented features and known issues in the final submission of the Reversi game project. The project encompasses a GUI-based implementation of the Reversi game, integrating various components like the Model, Controller, and View.

### Features Successfully Implemented

#### Core Components

Model: Fully functional game logic, encapsulating the core rules and mechanics of Reversi.

Controller: Efficient handling of game operations, ensuring smooth gameplay and user interactions.

View: Robust and responsive GUI, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for game interactions.

#### Enhanced User Experience

Pop-ups: Implemented pop-ups for Game Over and invalid moves, enhancing the user feedback mechanism.

Game Over Recognition: The JFrame title updates to reflect the game's conclusion, providing a clear indication of the game's end state.

### Game Strategies

Provider Strategy - CaptureMax: Successfully adapted the CaptureMax strategy, providing a strategic depth to the game.

### Technical Enhancements

Coordinate System: Modified the coordinate system to align with the project requirements, ensuring accurate gameplay interactions.

GUI Improvements: Enhanced the board rendering with GUI image additions and custom fonts, offering a visually appealing interface.

Game Over Notifications: Implemented functionality to notify providers about the game's conclusion, indicating the winner or loser in the JFrame title.

### Known Issues and Limitations

#### Resizing Issue

The JFrame may not be resizable in certain scenarios, potentially due to external constraints or monitor-specific settings. This issue is yet to be resolved and might be experienced by some users.

#### Additional Strategies

Extra credit strategies, other than CaptureMax, were not implemented in this version of the project. The focus was maintained on the core functionality and the CaptureMax strategy.

## Conclusion

This project represents a comprehensive effort to create an engaging and functional Reversi game. While it successfully includes several key features and enhancements, there are areas for potential improvement in future updates, particularly in terms of JFrame resizing capabilities and the incorporation of additional strategies.
