/**
 * <p>The {@code Hex} class represents an axial coordinate in a hexagonal grid.
 * Axial coordinates use two axes (q and r) to represent positions
 * within a hexagonal grid. Axial coordinates were used for our implementation of the Reversi
 * model as they are more intuitive to use than cube coordinates (i.e., they provide the same
 * amount of information with less data and axial coords more closely resemble the
 * row x column representation of a Cartesian coordinate system, which is generally
 * more widely used and familiarized).</p>
 *
 * <p>In this coordinate system, the following invariants apply:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> q + r + s = 0 </li>
 * <li> s = -q - r </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Fields of this class are final and private, ensuring thread safety for use
 * in concurrent applications.<\p>
 *
 * <p>Methods in this class are public as they are simply used to get information about
 * this Hex and don't involve any mutation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Information about the hex grid and the axial coordinate system was retrieved from the
 * following site: https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#neighbors</p>
