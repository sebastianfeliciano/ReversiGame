 * <p>The {@code IMutableModel} represents a mutable model of the game cs3500.reversi.Reversi.
 * This model allows three movements to control a game of cs3500.reversi.Reversi.
 * It can either start a game of cs3500.reversi.Reversi (if it hasn't been started yet).
 * Once the game has started, this model allows making a move
 * (ensuring that it is the correct player's turn making the move and
 * the move is both legal and valid), and it can skip turns to the next player.</p>
 *
 * <p>Any specific moves that control the state of the game (such as capturing a disc,
 * checking if a move is legal, getting the neighbors of a cell that a player
 * hopes to play a disc on) are implemented in the classes that implement this
 * interface to allow more flexibility of different versions of the
 * game and to avoid unnecessary coupling or mutations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface extends {@code IROModel} and is able to access any of its methods.</p>
